                Event marketing is growing at a rate of three times that of traditional advertising. Though relatively small compared to the major components of the marketing communications mix-advertising, sales promotions and P-O-P communications-expenditures on event sponsorship are increasing. Corporate sponsorships in India in 2001 were estimated at$3.9 billion-with 65% of this total going to sports events and most of the remainder spent on sponsoring entertainment tours or festival and fairs. Thousands of companies invest in some form of event sponsorship. Defined, event marketing is a form of brand promotion that ties a brand to a meaningful athletic, entertainment, cultural, social or other type of high-interest public activity. Event marketing is distinct from advertising, sales promotion, point-of-purchase merchandising, or public relations, but it generally incorporates elements from all of these promotional tools. Event promotions have an opportunity to achieve success because, unlike other forms of marketing communications, events reach people when they are receptive to marketing messages and capture people in a relaxed atmosphere.

                Event marketing is growing rapidly because it provides companies alternatives to the cluttered mass media, an ability to segment on a local or regional basis, and opportunities for reaching narrow lifestyle groups whose consumption behaviour can be linked with the local event. MasterCard invested an estimated $25 million in sponsoring the nine-city World Cup soccer championship in the United States in 1994 and will likely sponsor other big events in many countries as well.

Over the past ten to fifteen years, the event management industry has witnessed huge growth. Each year, across the world, nearly $500 billion is spent on planned events. 
                International Event management companies are hired to organize a wide range of events. These companies can organize events for small groups of people, or big events with thousands of attendees. Lots of businesses use event management services, to ensure that their events run smoothly and professionally. Event planning is a stressful, time consuming and expensive activity. An event management company has the expertise and industry contacts to offer a dependable service, at an affordable price. Let’s take a closer look at how these companies approach organising different types of events: 
            </p>

            <h4>Leisure Events </h4>
            <p>
                Leisure event management is an interesting and diverse field. It involves managing facilities like sports grounds, recreation centres, parks and entertainment venues. Also, it can involve managing a celebration or festival, sporting contest or concert. 
                The leisure events companies that manage these activities hire an engaged and enthusiastic workforce, who know their target audience. Moreover, these professionals have the expertise to carry out all the necessary administration and planning. The skill of the leisure event manager lies in his/her ability to understand what the event taking place means to those who are in attendance. 
                Also, a leisure event manager needs to incorporate value adding measures, to improve the experience of event goers. These measures could be delivered via technology, such as simulators or white knuckle rides in visitor attractions, or screen and sound systems in cinemas. The measures could be delivered through staff management, with service blueprinting to define staff roles in animating, motivating and engaging with customers. Or, the measures could be delivered through other work procedures and customer communication methods, to enhance the service quality, customer flow and circulation. This might encompass ticket purchasing, automatic entry, sight lines and signage, booking systems, and other similar technology that underpins the structure of an event. 
            </p>
            <h4>Cultural Events </h4>
            <p>
                Often, cultural events are meant to enrich the cultural standing of the city in which they are held. Cultural events teams create unique festivals, memorable outdoor spectacles, accessible entertainment and unexpected arts. Often, these teams work alongside local government authorities. Every year, they will plan innovative cultural programmes and events, and advertise and oversee them from start to finish. 
                Managing a cultural event is a major undertaking. Festivals seem glamorous and exciting but in reality, they are hard work in every respect. Cultural event managers have to deliver an artistic and cultural programme, which will appeal to the public. However, they have to take local sensitivities into account, adhere to strict planning and health and safety rules, and still make a profit. 
                Cultural event managers need skills in fundraising and finance, public relations and arts marketing. Typically, these events management companies have tight budgets, and are dependent on part time staff, enthusiastic volunteers and freelance contractors. Obviously, styles of cultural events management vary, based on the genre and size of events. Nonetheless, all cultural events are linked to the well being of the community and issues of identity. Also, they all tap into the visitor and tourist economy. 
            </p>
            <h4>Personal Events </h4>
            <p>
                Invariably, it takes a lot of time, effort and dedication to organize a personal event. With catering arrangements, types of menus, guest lists, booking the venue and designing the décor, there are countless details that have to be scheduled and coordinated. In the past, personal events management companies only dealt with indoor events. However, nowadays, these companies manage outdoor events as well. 
                A personal event management company will bring a party to life, with colors, patterns, spectacular backdrops and lighting effects that will enchant all the guests present. Indeed, these companies specialise in organising funky, uniquely themed events. The company will consult with the customer to discuss the precise requirements, and then tailor the event in line with the customer’s budget. Venue booking, marquee erecting, menu planning and live entertainment provision is all included in the service. 
                Not all customers for these types of events require complete event management. Hence, personal event management services can be enlisted to organize only part of an event — for example, the hiring of entertainment or the catering. Initial consultations will determine which parts of the event would be best left to a professional organizer, and which parts the event hosts can tackle themselves. Often, the division of labour is decided by budget, and by the customer’s relative expertise. 
            </p>
            <h4>Organizational Events </h4>
            <p>
                Organizational events can include political, charitable and commercial events, as well as sales events, such as product launches, etc. A company that hosts an all day event for several thousand people will require catering, entertainment and accommodation arranging for all the guests. Event staff will need to be recruited, a room to host the event will have to be chosen, seating arrangements will need to be determined and obviously, an event budget has to be established. An organisational events management company will have expertise in all of these areas. 
                Also, these companies might be hired to do more than simply plan and execute an event. They may be enlisted to implement a communications, marketing and brand building strategy as well. An organisational events manager understands the technical, logistical and creative factors that make an event successful. This includes audio visual production, event design, logistics, scriptwriting, negotiation, budgeting and of course, customer service. For bigger organisational events, in the preparation stage, the events manager has to make important decisions and choices linked to the event’s creative concept and design. To ensure that the event runs to plan, the events manager requires extensive technical design expertise, and a clear grasp of how to convey a company’s message in the public arena. 
                Obviously, event management is a multifaceted profession. The scale of the task involved in managing the above types of events is significant. It is hardly surprising that the industry is thriving.
